# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-18)

**Core value:** Students never miss a deadline or lose track of their week — Aria surfaces what matters, when it matters, over SMS.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — infrastructure-foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (infrastructure-foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

| Phase 01-infrastructure-foundation P01 | 5 | 2 tasks | 11 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Use Next.js 15.2 (not 14) — async Request API breaking change avoidable now, painful to migrate later
- Roadmap: Use pgvector (Supabase extension) instead of Chroma — eliminates separate Railway service at MVP scale
- Roadmap: Phase 7 (Frontend UI) can begin parallel with Phase 5 — Seb can build against stable Phase 3-4 APIs
- Roadmap: GCal + Gmail watch channel renewal (SYNC-04) ships in Phase 5 alongside initial watch setup — not deferrable
- Roadmap: TCPA compliance (SYNC-02, SMS-04 through SMS-09) ships in Phase 3 with first SMS capability — legal requirement
- [Phase 01-infrastructure-foundation]: No Supabase DB write in tasks.ping — deferred to Phase 2 when real users exist, avoids PING_TEST_USER_ID placeholder
- [Phase 01-infrastructure-foundation]: Dockerfile over Nixpacks for Railway — explicit Python 3.12 version control, no Railway-specific build magic
- [Phase 01-infrastructure-foundation]: Used @supabase/ssr with getClaims() (not deprecated @supabase/auth-helpers or getSession()) for session persistence in Next.js 15 App Router
- [Phase 01-infrastructure-foundation]: server.ts createClient() is async (await cookies()) — required for Next.js 15 async Request API; handle_new_user trigger uses SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = '' to prevent injection

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Google OAuth app verification (Gmail readonly is a sensitive scope) can take 1–6 weeks. Start the Google Cloud Console verification request before Phase 5 begins, ideally during Phase 3.
- Verify `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` is a valid model string before Phase 5 implementation. Use `anthropic.models.list()`.
- Confirm Vercel function timeout limit (Hobby vs Pro plan) before Phase 3 deployment — affects error handling on webhook paths.
